        <section class="aboutMeClass element1">
            <p>I have been working as a mobile developer for the past two years, where I have had the opportunity to create innovative applications and improve user experiences. I am happily married and have been enjoying this wonderful journey for the past year. In my free time, I love to take my dogs out for training sessions, which keeps both them and me active and healthy.

                Additionally, I am passionate about continuous learning and strive to enhance my skills in development. I believe that staying updated with the latest technologies and trends is essential in this ever-evolving field</p>
