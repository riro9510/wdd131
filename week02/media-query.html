            <h2>Alma 42:13</h2>
            <p>13 Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice. Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God.</p>

            <h2>D&C 84:33-39</h2>
            <p>33 For whoso is faithful unto the obtaining these two priesthoods of which I have spoken, and the magnifying their calling, are sanctified by the Spirit unto the renewing of their bodies.

                34 They become the sons of Moses and of Aaron and the seed of Abraham, and the church and kingdom, and the elect of God.
                
                35 And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;
                
                36 For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;
                
                37 And he that receiveth me receiveth my Father;
                
                38 And he that receiveth my Father receiveth my Fatherâ€™s kingdom; therefore all that my Father hath shall be given unto him.
                
                39 And this is according to the oath and covenant which belongeth to the priesthood.</p>
